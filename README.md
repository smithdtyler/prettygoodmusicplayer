=====================

A music player for Android that hits the basics hard

I do my best to address issues when they arise, but I'm pretty busy, so it may take a long time for me to push updates.

If you want to motivate me to work on a particular feature, please consider a donation to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/).Just tell me about your donation by commenting on the appropriate issue and I'll be like "woah, I better work on this!" 

If you're having troubles with media button presses being ignored, check out Media Button Router: https://github.com/harleensahni/media-button-router

Building: 
I've been building this in Eclipse. For Android Studio do 'Import Project' -> select build.gradle -> click 'Yes' for the gradle wrapper (or choose your own gradle folder. Wrapper is recommended as AStudio is finicky about which version it uses)
