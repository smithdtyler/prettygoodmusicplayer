prettygoodmusicplayer
=====================

A music player for Android that hits the basics hard

Building: 
I've been building this in Eclipse. For Android Studio do 'Import Project' -> select build.gradle -> click 'Yes' for the gradle wrapper (or choose your own gradle folder. Wrapper is recommended as AStudio is finicky about which version it uses)


Installing:
The production version is available here:
